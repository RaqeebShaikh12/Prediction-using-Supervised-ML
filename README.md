# Prediction-using-Supervised-ML

## Task 1: Prediction of percentage of marks on the basis of no of hours studied

This project is a part of the internship program offered by The Sparks Foundation. The objective of the project is to build a simple linear regression model that can predict the percentage of marks scored by a student based on the number of hours they have studied.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains two variables:

Hours: Number of hours studied by the student
Scores: Percentage of marks scored by the student
