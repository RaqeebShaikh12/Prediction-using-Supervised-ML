# Prediction-using-Supervised-ML

## Task 1: Prediction of percentage of marks on the basis of no of hours studied

This project is a part of the internship program offered by The Sparks Foundation. The objective of the project is to build a simple linear regression model that can predict the percentage of marks scored by a student based on the number of hours they have studied.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains two variables:

* Hours: Number of hours studied by the student
* Scores: Percentage of marks scored by the student

The dataset can be found on the given link[http://bit.ly/w-data].

### Installation

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your machine along with the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* statsmodel

You can install these libraries using the following command in your terminal:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib sklearn statsmodel

### Files

* ML_Project_Predict_the_Percentage_of_Marks.ipynb: contains jupyter notebook with all the code required to build the model.
* README.md: This file which contain all the information related to the project.

### Conclusion

I utilized various tools such as the statsmodels.api library and other Python packages to implement a simple linear regression algorithm. Through this approach, the model achieved an accuracy rate of 89.44% on a test dataset.

### Credits

This project was completed as a part of the internship program offered by The Sparks Foundation.
